On team empowerment

Translators spend a huge amount of time with the content of a company. They have seen more content than anyone, and know more about the products of a company than a random person in support does. They know approximately as much as the most hard core user of the productsâ€¦ 
To account for their hourly price, they should be enabled to deliver added value, which arises in the slipstream of their translation work:

To authors:
* Feedback on source content to authors of the content 
* Consistency
* Errors
* Ambiguities 

To marketing departments:

* Incompatibility of source content with target countries (e.g. legal restrictions; payment options, etc.)

To developers:
* Feedback on technical solutions to decrease number of words (i.e. adding variables instead of strings) to developers
* Feedback to the developers on length restrictions
