# Reduce waste in your translation process

Do you feel your translation process should be optimized in order to meet the international business challenges? And are you not afraid to make some changes in the way you work? Meet us, translation innovation consultants Subject to Change.

## Translation starts to hurt when it is time to scale up. 

Most companies are perfectly capable of publishing their content in one or two languages. 
Time to market is acceptable, costs are within range and usually these are languages that someone in house can assess. 
The trouble starts when internationalization is taking off and publishing is necessary in 3 or more languages. 
All of a sudden, multilingual publishing starts to hurt. So much that it will seriously endanger the results of international expansion.

In most cases companies turn to a translation agency for help, leaving their internal processes for content creation and publishing as they are. 

Usually, they find that not only have costs increased by a factor 2, a lot of effort is still required and the 
time to market and quality is still not what is needed in order to reach the international challenges of the company. 

In most organizations the costs of a broken translation process are substantial. And even more, the opportunities if the process is not broken are countless.

## What is the cause of all this? 

The main issue is that standard translation processes do not allow for change and - consequently - for failure. 
As these days, quality is defined as the ability to quickly respond to user feedback, change must be at the core of your process. Moreover, as content creation and translation is still a human task, mistakes are made and need to be corrected. 
However, most publishing processes in multiple languages break when this happens. 

People's natural reactions to this are the following:

* Try to prevent mistakes, and build in review and QA cycles in the process. This slows down the time to market, is even more expensive and also not 100% effective
* Only start translation after the source content has been frozen. No change can be made in the source content after it has been sent for translation. 
This seriously impacts the quality of the source content. 
* Panic when something goes wrong after all.

## What can we do for you? 

We will help you design and implement a translation process that will reduce error-prone manual labor and does not break when changes need to made.

Our approach is built on working in short cycles and continuous flow and easily processing changes following user feedback, both to source and target languages.

In order to achieve this we can:
* Automate all file handling by selecting and implementing a translation workflow platform
* Eliminate waste by optimizing the entire workflow, taking content creation in account 
* Build self-organizing translation teams that will allow you to cut the middle man and increase speed, quality and reduce costs.
* Implement translation software that allows translators to boost their productivity

## What will this bring you? 

* A robust, automated translation process that allows for change and failure
* A cost decrease for translation and overhead of potentially 50% 
* Substantial improvement of time to market
* Happier, empowered people and higher quality translations

### Who are we?

We are "Subject to change", currently consisting of Ellen Cuijpers, Tessa Kempen and Anouk Perquin. 
Together we have 20 years experience in the translation industry. 

Our mission is to close the gap between the possibilities that arise when applying agile methodologies and state of the art technology and the condition organizations are currently in when it comes to multilingual content creation. 







Problem statement
* Multilingual publishing starts to hurt when it has to scale. And then it's too late. 
This can lead to a situation where having to publish in multiple languages can actually become a bottleneck in international expansion, in terms of speed, effort, quality and costs. 

Causes to the problem
* Processes do not allow for change or failure
* File and version management is error prone
* Traditional QA/review processes are too expensive, take too long and are not effective
* Translation only takes place after source text has been reviewed multiple times because changes are too costly to implement in several languages
* Source content is not stored in a structured way

Our solution to the problem

* Design processes with change at the core
  How much as we would like human translation to be perfect, it never is.
* QA == being able to change content as it is used
* Kort cyclisch werken met snelle user feedback
* Automation of file handling 
* Optimizing the whole: also take the content creation process into account and reduce waste in the entire process

Outcome:

*
