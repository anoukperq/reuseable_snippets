# Reduce waste in your translation process

Do you feel your translation process should be optimized in order to meet the international business challenges? And are you ready to make some changes in the way you work? Translation innovation consultant Anouk Perquin and her colleagues can show you how to take an other approach to the multilingual content creation process which addresses the real bottlenecks when it comes to translation.

## Translation starts to hurt when it is time to scale up

Most companies are perfectly capable of publishing their content in one or two languages. 
Time to market is acceptable, costs are within range and usually these are languages that someone in house can assess. 
The trouble starts when internationalization is taking off and publishing is necessary in 3 or more languages. 
All of a sudden, multilingual publishing starts to hurt. So much that it will seriously endanger the results of international expansion.

In most cases companies turn to a translation agency for help, leaving their internal processes for content creation and publishing unchanged. 

Usually, they find that costs have increased by a factor 2, but it is not really solving the bottleneck: a lot of effort is still required and the time to market and quality is still not sufficient to reach the international challenges of the company. 

In most organizations the costs of a broken translation process are substantial. Additionally, there are countless opportunities if the translation process is not broken and there is flexibility in publishing and editing.

## What is the real cause of the bottlenecks? 

The main issue is that standard translation processes do not allow for change and - consequently - for failure. 
Nowadays, quality is defined as the ability to quickly respond to user feedback. Moreover, as content creation and translation is still a human task, mistakes are made and need to be corrected. This means change must be at the core of your process.
However, most publishing processes in multiple languages break when changes to content have to be made, whether it's in the source or target language. 

People's natural reactions to this are the following:

* Try to prevent mistakes, and build in review and QA cycles in the process. This slows down the time to market, is even more expensive and also not 100% effective;
* Only start translation after the source content is completely done and freeze the source. No change can be made in the source content after it has been sent for translation. This seriously impacts the quality of the source content; 
* Panic if and when something goes wrong after all. 

## What can we do for you? 

We will help you design and implement a translation process that will reduce error-prone manual labor and does not break when changes need to made.

Our approach is built on the lean and agile principles of software development and production. This means working in short cycles, applying single item flow and a focus on getting and implementing user feedback, both to source and target languages.

In order to achieve this we can:
* Automate all file handling by selecting and implementing a translation workflow platform;
* Eliminate waste by optimizing the entire workflow, taking content creation into account; 
* Build self-organizing translation teams that will allow you to cut the middle man and increase speed, quality and reduce costs;
* Implement translation software that allows translators to boost their productivity. This leads to a dramatic drop in speed and - if you hire them yourself, cost reduction. 

## What will this bring you? 

* A robust, automated translation process that allows for change and failure;
* A cost decrease for translation and overhead of potentially 50%; 
* Substantial improvement of time to market;
* Happier, empowered people and higher quality translations.
