Do you recognize this? [problem statement]

Most companies are perfectly capable of publishing their content in one or two languages. 
Time to market is acceptable, costs are within range and usually these are languages that someone in house can assess. 
The trouble starts when internationalization is taking off and publishing is necessary in 3 languages or more. 
All of the sudden, the process of multilingual publishing starts to hurt. This potentially seriously endangers the international expansion. 

In most cases companies turn to a translation agency for help, leaving their internal processes for content creation and publishing as they are. 
Usually, they find that not only have costs increased by a factor 2, a lot of effort is still required and the 
time to market and quality is still not what would be ideal in order to reach the international challenges of the company. 

Why is this happening? 

The main issue is that standard translation processes are not allowing for change and - consequently - for failure. 
And as, for most content, content creation and translation is still a human task - things will go wrong and need to be corrected. 
Most translation processes break when this happens. 

The natural tendency of people is to have more review and QA cycles in the process. 
However, this slows down the time to market, is even more expensive and also not 100% effective





Problem statement
* Multilingual publishing starts to hurt when it has to scale. And then it's too late. 
This can lead to a situation where having to publish in multiple languages can actually become a bottleneck in international expansion, in terms of speed, effort, quality and costs. 

Causes to the problem
* Processes do not allow for change or failure
* File and version management is error prone
* Traditional QA/review processes are too expensive, take too long and are not effective
* Translation only takes place after source text has been reviewed multiple times because changes are too costly to implement in several languages
* Source content is not stored in a structured way

Our solution to the problem

* Design processes with change at the core
  How much as we would like human translation to be perfect, it never is.
* QA == being able to change content as it is used
* Kort cyclisch werken met snelle user feedback
* Automation of file handling 
* Optimizing the whole: also take the content creation process into account and reduce waste in the entire process

Outcome:

* A robust, automated translation process that allows for change and failure
* A potential cost decrease for translation and overhead of 50% 
* Substantial improvement of time to market 
* Happier, empowered people and higher quality translations
