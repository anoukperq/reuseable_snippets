Problem statement
* Multilingual publishing starts to hurt when it has to scale. And then it's too late. 
This can lead to a situation where having to publish in multiple languages can actually become a bottleneck in international expansion, in terms of speed, effort, quality and costs. 


Causes to the problem
* Processes do not allow for change or failure
* File and version management is error prone
* Traditional QA/review processes are too expensive, take too long and are not effective
* Translation only takes place after source text has been reviewed multiple times because changes are too costly to implement in several languages
* Source content is not stored in a structured way

Our solution to the problem

* Design processes with change at the core
  How much as we would like human translation to be perfect, it never is.
* QA == being able to change content as it is used
* Kort cyclisch werken met snelle user feedback
* Automation of file handling 
* Optimizing the whole: also take the content creation process into account

Outcome:

* A robust, automated translation process that allows for change and failure
* A potential cost decrease for translation and overhead of 50% 
* Substantial improvement of time to market 
* Happier, empowered people and higher quality translations
