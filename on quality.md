# On being a ‘good’ translator

Good translators are translators who, in spite of total disconnection with context, know when something could possibly be ambiguous, and dive in when this could be the case. Thus leading to decrease in productivity, since the aim to be productive is exactly what is stopping translators from doing this kind of research. 

Aspects of translation projects that introduce mistakes:
* Making glossaries beforehand without context and set it in stone
* Setting shorter deadlines so that the translation agency can do something with it (or makes sure they get it on time)
* Manage deadlines strictly and exhaust translators 

Solutions:

* Continuous publication of MVPs that have gone through the entire cycle (including terminology and consistency check and, if necessary, client review)
* Not waiting for translations to deploy your version, allow real time adjustment/adding of translations
* Building up your glossary as you go and enabling changes easily
* Measuring velocity, not imposing deadlines 
* Including user feedback and allowing easy implementing of comments, both internally and externally
