# How to integrate translation and content creation, and the impact it has on content creation

Translation is usually organized in a waterfall process. 
Induced by the current ecosystem with translation companies, content must first be ready and consolidated in order for a translator to start working. 

Once translating begins, the trouble starts. There is no way up the waterfall, so the translators have to deal with the source content they get.
Lots of ambiguous sentences, untranslatable idioms and sentences that become too long in the translated version are issues 
that translators have dealt to cope with, but that reduce their productivity severely and may impact the quality of the end result.

Moreover, and more importantly, translators can be seen as the first users of your content - and hardcore users. 
They will notice issues that the authors have not thought of when writing or editing, 
simply because translators dive into the matter more thoroughly than anyone else.

Including translators in the authoring process will not only improve the quality of your translations, 
but will also have impact on the quality of your source content. 
However, in order to make this work really nicely, a more agile and collaborative approach must be taken to the process of content creation.
