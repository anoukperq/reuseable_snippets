# How agile principles can help you create better multilingual content

# Goal of this article
This article aims to explain how applying agile principles to content creation and translation will significantly reduce waste and lead to a better end result. 

## The issue with translation
Translation is usually organized in a waterfall process. Induced by the current ecosystem with translation companies, content must first be ready and consolidated in order for a translator to start working. Letting translators work on content that is not quite done to most people, feels like 'a waste of time and costs, as the content will still change'. 

But then translating begins, and the trouble starts. There is no way up the waterfall, so the translators have to deal with the source content they get.
Lots of ambiguous sentences, untranslatable idioms and sentences that become too long in the translated version are issues 
that translators have dealt to cope with, but that reduce their productivity severely and may impact the quality of the end result - time, costs and quality of the translations are all affected.

## The value of translators
Moreover, and more importantly, translators can be seen as the first users of your content - and hardcore users. 
They will notice issues that the authors have not thought of when writing or editing, 
simply because translators dive into the matter more thoroughly than anyone else. In the current translation ecosystem, there is no efficient infrastructure for translators to express their valuable feedback and it is often seen as 'complicated and disturbing'. 

## What can we solve if we combine this? 
The obvious answer: including translators in the authoring process will not only improve the quality of your translations, 
but will also impact the quality of your source content. However, for this to work well, the authoring process needs to be adjusted: to a more collaborative, iterative process that allows all contributors to give feedback on publishable, eventhough not finished versions. 

But how to go about this? Often, collaboration is seen as a time-consuming, expensive addition to writing on your own. So how do you make sure collaboration does not lead to frustration and actually leads to faster publishing, more feedback from your users AND early involvement and empowerment of your translators?

In this article I will explain how a paradigm shift towards taking a more agile and collaborative approach on authoring and translation will free you of waste in content creation and translation.

## The trouble with writing content

Ever wrote a piece of text with blood, sweat and tears? Trying to make it perfect before you sent it to the editors or for peer review? Only to find that no matter how great you thought your article was, the crowd always comes up with something to improve on your piece, sometimes with corrections that go at the core of your story? A very painful moment, which makes it hard for any normal human being to remain open to feedback and learning. 

By the time you have rewritten your piece, gone through the review cycles and are ready for publication, the subject you wrote about has already expired. Too bad, you were too late to get the views and the discussion you were hoping for. 

Software developers have experienced this for decades. So many software projects, even when they are relatively succesful, are delivered too late for the features to be what the user wants in this moment in time. In the current speed of change, everything has to be deployed yesterday in order to be up-to-date with current needs.
