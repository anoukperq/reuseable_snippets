Many departments in organisations currently have the need for translation of several types of content. This need is now taken care of in a fragmented and ad hoc manner. There is often a need to take a central and knowledgeable approach to this complex issue.

The goals of implementing a professional translation process are:

* Translation activities in several parts of the organisation are carried out in a central system;
* The linguistic data that results from these activities are stored in one central place;
* This data is used to enhance the translation quality and productivity;
* The costs are minimized, because translated content can be reused;
* Turn around times are shortened;
* Changes in existing content can be quickly implemented in all languages;
* Minimal overhead and error proneness during execution of the translation;
* Overview of the ROI of translation and input for choices on what to translate. 

In order to obtain these goals, I propose to execute the following activities.

## Quick Scan and consultancy report
This proposal includes a quick scan, resulting in a report with recommendations. The report contains the following items:

### Quick scan findings
* Stakeholders, their role in the process and their concerns and interests
* Type of content that needs to be available to the public in multiple languages
* Languages for each type of content
* Current systems the content is in
* Frequency of added/changed content
* Current translation process 
* Available (multilingual) content and language assets
* Current system architecture
* Skills that are present in the organization that could contribute to the translation process

### Recommendations 
* how to improve on the current translation process
* preliminary ROI calculations, 
* preliminary roadmap of implementation

Following this report, an offer for the execution of implementation can be issued. 
This implementation includes the selection of tooling, calculation of ROI, implementation and integration of software applications, sourcing translators, training employees that are involved in the translation process and if necessary project management of the actual translation projects. 

The quick scan and consultancy report can be executed within a time frame of approx. 3 to 4 weeks and will take between 10 to 15 days at a daily rate of  â‚¬ 995,- excl. VAT. This includes incorporation of feedback on the report.
